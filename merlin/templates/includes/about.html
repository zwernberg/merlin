              Sarah and Zach first crossed paths at the University of Wisconsin in 2013. Zach was working at the gym with his friend Ryan, who had lived on the same floor as Sarah freshman year of college. Many of their initial interactions took place at a house on Broom Street known as “Old Blue”, which housed Ryan and five more of Sarah’s closest college friends. Sarah once offered to share a blanket with Zach, but in an ill-advised move, he said no, and she tabled the idea of dating him.

              Spring semester, Zach was working on the university gym website, and Sarah was teaching spin classes. As the semester progressed, she found herself running into Zach *every* time she was at the gym to teach. Little did she know, he had changed his schedule to overlap with hers. Staying after class later and later to talk, he eventually asked her on a date. Zach suggested dinner; Sarah countered with a “short six-mile run”. Somehow the running date won, and they never looked back.

              After graduating, Sarah moved to Jacksonville, FL for a year to serve with AmeriCorps while Zach finished his degree in Computer Science. She moved back to Wisconsin a year later to start medical school, and since then they have lived together in Madison, where they call home.

              Zach proposed to Sarah on a rainy May evening in a restaurant overlooking Lake Mendota. Sarah had recently bought a book of poems, and he found a favorite, reading its words (scribbled on a torn scrap of paper, now framed in their kitchen) aloud. The restaurant patrons stood in suspense, and two of her best friends came into view. Shaking with excitement, she said yes!
